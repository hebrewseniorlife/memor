This package is intended for data scientists, statisticians, and allied scientists who use rmarkdown to conduct reproducible research but require flexibility in document formatting. It is based on a pre-existing latex template that we have updated for use in RStudio or equivalent environments. A notable inclusion is a feature allowing the user to save develop a common configuration file, which can be shared among the team within a working environment.

# Getting Started
Here are the list of options that is available in `memor`. As with the default `rmarkdown` template, not all need be specified. At the same time, it can also take all the other options from `rmarkdown::pdf_document`, such as `keep_tex`, `includes`, etc.

toc - Table of Contents  
lot - List of Tables  
lof - List of Figures  
 
```

In the interest of reducing the length of 'yaml' headers and allowing for standardization within teams, we have developed a mechanism that allows one to save one's configuration or "profile" in an isolated file, which can be reused for other reports and shared with colleagues. During the process of rendering, information saved in the profile file will be automatically pulled and used to generate the final document (but information defined in local environment will be used with priority). 

To better facilitate this process, we created a RStudio Addin to help you quickly locate the file. This addin does nothing but to open up the `~/memor-profile.yaml` file in your home directory (if this file doesn't exist, it will create one). Note that if you have a profile but you don't want to use the profile for certain document, you can disable this behavior by setting the `use_profile` option to `false.` Furthermore, you can customize the location of the profile file by using the `memor_profile` option, which can be specified in a `.Rprofile`. This might be useful on a RStudio Server, where system admin can specify a R profile for everyone. In this way, the entire group will share the same file by default.
